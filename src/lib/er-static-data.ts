Cut around the bottom of the lake, avoiding the patrolling mercenary, and then cut Southeast across the field toward the road. You should see a the Agheel Lake South grace point on a little shelf below the road.&nbsp;From the grace, there are at least 4 noble sorcerers nearby, but 2 are easy to reach. Wait for the mercenary patrolling the road to ride by, then head across the road and left until you're climbing the slope. One sorcerer &amp; retinue will be coming down this slope from the camp above. After killing them, turn around, and there is another sorcerer &amp; retinue traveling down the road. You may want to wait for the mercenary to pass again, because he takes actual effort to fight (whereas the sorcerers have bad eyesight and go down quickly).

If you start from the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace and kill the sitting Cuckoo Knight last, you'll have to either run back to the site of grace, kill all the surrounding mobs or use your Memory of Grace, since being in combat will prevent you from fast traveling.    Alternative route (click for image): Start in the Bellum Church and head east. While behind the ruin (Point 1), summon your spirit ash. Go around to the front, and immediately kill the caster standing on the ruin (just to make the fight less annoying). Kill the Cuckoo Knight&nbsp; and two other mobs (Point 2); while fighting, a farther mob will sound a horn. This will summon a horseback Knight. While fighting the horseback Knight, another will come around during their standard patrol. After these three have been killed, head south-west and then east to go up the hill to Point 3. A solo Knight will be here. After killing, refill on HP/FP and jump down the ruins and follow the path to Point 4. Summon your ashes again to fight the group on the road, including a Knight.

Go to the Third Church of Marika and face Southeast. Ride your horse until the cliff meets the water. The cliff side here should have a more red hue to it than the rest of the stone typically found in Limgrave. If you’re facing the wall due East you’ll notice a cragged vertical line where one part of the cliff face is protruding from another. Double jump on Torrent while following that and you should now be riding up the cliff face. Now turn your camera to face Northeast, you’ll notice what appears to be an arrowhead of grey stone forming a flat surface among the red-hued cliff. Jump there. Turn the camera South. While it doesn’t look feasible, sprint jump with torrent towards the protrusion across the before mentioned cragged vertical line. When you land, quickly double jump (facing East) to get on top of the ledge. You’ll notice above you several steps in the cliff face just slightly to the right- climb those. Then, jump due North onto the final platform. You will now be above the cliff and able to drop down.  </li></ul>",
